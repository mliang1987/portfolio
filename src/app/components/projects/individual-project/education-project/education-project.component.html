<h1>High School Coding Curriculum: Game-Based Learning at Brooke High School</h1>

<p>
  At Brooke High School, I developed a <strong>hands-on programming curriculum</strong> that introduced students to
  <strong>fundamental coding concepts</strong> through engaging, interactive projects. By incorporating
  <strong>game-based learning</strong>, students learned
  <strong>object-oriented programming, algorithmic problem-solving, and event-driven development</strong> in a dynamic
  way.
</p>

<h2>Curriculum Highlights</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Interactive Coding</strong> – Students learned by modifying and expanding real-world projects.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Game Development Approach</strong> – Lessons focused on <em>Java</em>, <em>Processing</em>, and
    <em>game logic</em>, reinforcing core programming skills.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Problem-Solving Skills</strong> – The curriculum emphasized
    <em>critical thinking, data structures, and software design principles</em>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Featured Starter Projects</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Processing Demos</strong> – Introduced <em>visual programming</em> concepts, helping students manipulate
    graphics through <em>Processing</em>.

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Battleship Game Simulator</strong> – Reinforced <em>data structures and game logic</em> using Java-based
    mechanics.

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Starfighter Game</strong> – Focused on <em>physics-based movement</em> and <em>interactive gameplay</em>,
    encouraging creativity in game development.

</ul>

<p>
  By working on these projects, students developed the confidence to <strong>modify, optimize, and create</strong> their
  own software applications, preparing them for future opportunities in
  <strong>computer science and software engineering</strong>. My goal was to
  <strong>bridge the gap between theory and practice</strong>, fostering innovation and curiosity through
  <strong>real-world coding applications</strong>.

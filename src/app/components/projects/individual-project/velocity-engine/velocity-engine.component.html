    >Velocity</a
  >, developed by <a href="https://www.varian.com/" target="_blank">Varian</a> is a sophisticated oncology management
  software designed to unify and analyze patient imaging and treatment data from multiple sources. It enables clinicians
  to transform disconnected data into actionable clinical insights, facilitating more informed decision-making. The
  software supports multimodal image fusion, allowing the integration of CT, CBCT, MRI, PET, SPECT, and RT images,
  regardless of their origin or acquisition time. This capability provides a comprehensive view of a patient's clinical
  history, helping oncologists assess treatment response and plan future interventions with greater precision.

  One of Velocity's standout features is its deformable image registration, which enables clinicians to track anatomical
  changes over time. By registering images from different modalities and time points, the software allows for accurate
  comparisons and voxel-based analysis, ensuring that treatment plans remain aligned with evolving patient anatomy.
  Additionally, Velocity offers advanced contouring tools, including automated PET contouring and adaptive
  re-contouring, streamlining the process of defining treatment areas. Its vendor-neutral platform ensures compatibility
  with various oncology information systems, making it a versatile solution for radiation therapy planning and
  evaluation.

  Beyond imaging, Velocity integrates dosimetry tools that help clinicians track cumulative radiation doses across
  different treatment sessions. This functionality is crucial for optimizing radiation therapy while minimizing exposure
  to healthy tissues. The software also facilitates collaborative treatment planning by enabling seamless data sharing
  among referring physicians, surgeons, and oncology teams. Overall, Velocity enhances workflow efficiency, improves
  treatment accuracy, and empowers oncology teams with robust data analytics and visualization tools.

  VelocityEngine is a scripting API developed by Varian for interacting with the Velocity oncology software. It provides
  **Python and C# clients** that allow users to automate workflows and extract data from Velocity. The API is designed
  for **non-clinical use**, meaning it is intended for research, development, and administrative tasks rather than
  direct patient treatment.
</p>

<p>VelocityEngine can be used in two primary environments:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Local Velocity Workstation</b> – A single-user setup where scripts interact with a standalone Velocity system.

</ul>

<p>
  To use VelocityEngine, a <b>script user account</b> must be created within the Velocity system. Each login consumes a
  license, ensuring controlled access to the software. The API enables users to retrieve imaging data, perform automated
  analyses, and integrate Velocity's capabilities into external applications.
